        "Alice Bouvot is the proud proprietor of 5 hectares of vines in the Arbois region of the Jura. Alice started her domaine in 2005 with just 2 hectares and over the years have bought small plots and slowly increased their production. Some of our favorite winery visits are with Alice and her adorable sons. On top of her warmth, the vineyards are equally as vibrant. L'Octavin is now Demeter biodynamic certified and she works to convey this message to the fullest. Wild grasses, weeds, insects, and animals all have a place in their vines creating a true ecosystem that gives a deeper meaning to each glass of her wine."

        "Giovanni Battista Mesina, 'the shepherd that makes wine', as he is known to the locals, was about to harvest grapes for his first bottled production of wine. Giovanni's wines were borne in his family's old animal stall with nothing more than grapes and intuition. To this day, on their hilltop homestead, Giovanni and his family raise over 1000 sheep.  They produce milk, cheese and wool as well as pasture-raised meat.  If you know anything about shepherds it's that they are sincere, stoic and reserved...when you meet Giovanni you feel his warm soulfulness, which is translated directly into the wines."

A small vineyard was planted focusing on mainly Bordeaux varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Merlot, Petit Verdot.  In 2000 as a family we moved up the hill next door and planted a larger vineyard of ten acres, comprising Bordeaux varieties and Pinot Noir, later including Saperavi and Chardonnay."

        "Do.t.e is an experimental entity that seeks alternative answers in the management of contemporary viticulture. It's taking one step back in order to go two steps forward. A return to agricultural origins that clearly defines the present and realistically imagines the future. It's the desire to stand out with wines that spontaneously expresses their reason for being —beyond statutes and production regulations— based on the foundational principles of the entire project: health, ethics, everyday.Going back to wine as something able to reflect places, arouse feelings, heat up relationships.The grapes are grown without using any systemic pesticides (fungicides, herbicides, insecticides). Musts and wines are treated in total absence of chemical and enological products (including sulphites). Each bottle is a deliberate result of a self-determined path; any differences need to be considered as parallel deviations proceeding in the same direction of the chosen path."
